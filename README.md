# Task Management System

A simple, responsive task management web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with features like adding, deleting, and completing tasks. It also categorizes tasks based on priority and moves completed tasks into a separate section.

## Features

- **Add Tasks:** Add tasks with a name, description, and priority level (High, Medium, Low).
- **Task Priority:** Tasks are sorted based on priority, with high-priority tasks displayed at the top.
- **Mark as Completed:** Tasks can be marked as completed, which moves them to a separate "Completed Tasks" section.
- **Delete Tasks:** Delete tasks you no longer need.
- **LocalStorage:** All tasks are saved to your browser’s local storage, allowing them to persist between sessions.
- **Responsive Design:** The layout adjusts based on screen size for a better user experience on mobile and desktop devices.
- **Animated Info Box:** The initial info message slowly disappears with a cool animation.
